  ## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE! ⚠️

  **TLDR: This is not a fully functional application. Although we hope to make it much better with a full rewrite in the future, if you want a Pomodoro timer, you should look elsewhere.**

  Hello! I'm UHDbits, the main developer of Pomoimprove. This may be a bit of a long story, but I'll try to get through it as soon as possible. Pomoimprove was created as a science fair project by both me and 53142, one of my friends and the other member of &#60;bit&#62; programming. The idea was created by myself because as someone who suffers from ADHD, I've always wanted a way to just be able to focus on work. We eventually, after around a month or two of learning Python and making this application, came up with a partially functional end result. After running tests, we found that this partially functional result helped improved productivity by a lot.

  **That partially functional result we made is what is in this repo. This application is a proof of concept for what could be, and what we plan to make in the future. All this application mainly does is lockdown your computer, and cycles through YouTube and Google Docs with time periods reminiscent of the Pomodoro Technique.**

  We do hope to make this application into a fully featured application in the future, but to do that, this code requires a complete rewrite, in a different programming language. This idea hasn't been started yet, but we do hope to start it soon. We also welcome you to fork this code (or start from scratch, which is the better idea) and make this application better (please let me know if you do because I will totally use it). Anyways, that's all I had to say. I probably didn't have to write this, but hey, why not.

  [**Usage**](#usage)

  ## Compiling
  1. **Make sure you are using a modern version of Python 3. This program has been tested on versions 3.10 and 3.11.**
  2. **Clone the repo:**  
  `git clone https://github.com/Bit-Programming/Pomoimprove-POC/Pomoimprove-POC.git`
  3. **Enter the directory with the repo contents and install the requirements:**  
  `cd Pomoimprove-POC && pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
  4. **Enter the "Build" directory and run build.py:**  
  `cd Build && python3 build.py` 

  ## Usage
  **Make sure you build the program at least once before trying to run it, either through the executable or running the straight Python files. This is because the build script extracts important files to the program's usage.**

  **For an example of usage of the application, you can watch [this example usage of the application here](/Resources/Pomoimprove.mp4). The usage of the application overall though is very simple.**

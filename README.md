# Pomoimprove  

## Compiling
1. Make sure you are using python version 3.11
2. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Bit-Programming/Pomoimprove/Pomoimprove.git`
3. Enter the directory with the repo contents and install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Enter the "Build" directory and run build.py (NOTE: WE NEED TO FINISH THE BUILD.PY FILE) `cd Build && python build.py` 

**DO THIS TO MAKE SURE THE PROGRAM WILL WORK AFTER MERGING (only needs to be done once):**  
Extract the Chrome.7z, place the "Chrome" folder (the one with chrome.exe) in the same directory as Chrome.7z (PROGRAM).

# **DO NOT DELETE CHROME.7Z FROM YOUR DIRECTORY!!!!!**
